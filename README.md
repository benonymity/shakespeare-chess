# Chess for Richard III

Scripts for downloading PGN files from [PGNMentor](http://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html) and filtering them using the [Python Chess module](https://pypi.org/project/chess/) by game length. Takes a lot of processing time to run, this whole project can be surpassed by [LiChess's Search Feature](https://lichess.org/games/search). 

**Purpose:** Designing a chess game around the [Backyard Shakespeare](http://backyardshakespeare.com/) performance of [Richard III](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/richardiii/full.html) this summer, which will be played live on stage, one move to a scene

### Definitions:
- Turn: White moves a piece, black moves a piece
- Move: One piece on the board is moved

### Requirements:

- Ideally a real, historical game, though not required.
- Ideally 15 turns (30 moves) or less, though can be slightly flexible. There are 25 scenes in Richard III.
- Queen taken on 19th move.
- 2 pawns taken on 17th move(s) (princes assasinated).
- Richard is probably white as he makes the first move, though he is as dark and evil as they come.
- Game ends in checkmate of Richard.
- Hopefully follows the rules of chess, but as the audience isn't going to be watching and analyzing we could possibly bend the rules a bit.
