does not matter who starts

pawns taken when princes sent to tower 3.1
    3 moves so that pawns of same color?
hastings dresses moves a piece, 3.2 (a big move, not just a pawn) starts trade down to checkmate
fewer moves before 3.2
bishop taken 3.7 (either side)
queen captured 4.4
ends in checkmate (horsey mate?) & before neck snap
